## Python-Based Inventory Management System

# This repository contains a Python-Based Inventory Management System that equips querying capabilities. 

The Part1.py file is designed to take .txt files as input, then provide output .txt files with updated information on the inventory based on the information from the input files. The output files will consist of the **Full Inventory List, Past Service Date List, Inventory Status Lists, and corresponding list/file for each type of device within the inventory.**
- (You can change the data in the **"ManufacturerList.txt", "PricesList.txt", and the "ServiceDatesLists.txt"** files and the output will update/adjust accordingly.)

The Part2.py file builds upon the practices in the part1.py file, but instead allows querying capabilities. The user will be prompted to enter a keyword about the device they are querying, then the closest match will be displayed along with the other closest possible result.
